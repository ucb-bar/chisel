ReleaseNotes for Chisel v2.2.28

This release of Chisel adds support for Chisel3 requirements. All
currently valid Chisel code should compile unchanged.

Two new options have been added

 * --minimumCompatibility xx.yy.zz
 * --wError

--minimumCompatibility will issue warnings for usage that is
incompatible with the specified version. To issue warnings for
currently valid code that will be incompatible with Chisel3, add the
following option to your Chisel compilation command:

    --minimumCompatibility 3

This will report warnings for the following Chisel3 issues -

 - Vec(Reg) should be replaced with Reg(Vec),
 - type-only vals (no associated data) must be wrapped in a Wire() if
   they will be the destination of a wiring operation (":=" or "<>"),
 - masked bit patterns ('b??') should be created using MInts(), not
   UInt() or Bits(),
 - the "clone" method required for parameterized Bundles has been
   renamed "cloneType".
 - the con and alt inputs to a Mux must be type-compatible - both
   signed or both unsigned.

In order to improve the association of line numbers with warnings, you
should also enable the --lineNumbers option.

--wError will turn all compiler warnings into errors. This in
combination with the --minimumCompatibility option will help determine
if your code is ready for Chisel3.

Look at the [Chisel tests](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel/tree/master/src/test/scala/) for
examples of these changes.
