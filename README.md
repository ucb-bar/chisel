About Chisel
============

Chisel is a new open-source hardware construction language developed
at UC Berkeley that supports advanced hardware design using highly
parameterized generators and layered domain-specific hardware languages.

Chisel is embedded in the Scala programming language, which raises the level
of hardware design abstraction by providing concepts including object
orientation, functional programming, parameterized types, and type inference.

Chisel can generate a high-speed C++-based cycle-accurate software simulator,
or low-level Verilog designed to pass on to standard ASIC or FPGA tools
for synthesis and place and route.
